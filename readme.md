# Ranking
At the first round, the best ranking we got was 2nd place.
But in the last 2hours, we didn't implement effiect ETF trading strategy and was overtaken by other
teams, the rank dropped to 6th.

During the last our, every team score was cleared, we tried an aggressive option which is short Gold Sachs at full position, it turned out the output is negative. So we switched to pair trading way, and it made us back to profit group and ended at 8th.
